## To use

Install it!

You can do this in Obsidian itself:

- Open Obsidian Settings
- Go to Appearance and click `Manage`
- Under community themes search for "cardstock" and click `Use`

Or, you can clone this repository into your `.obsidian/themes` folder in your vault.

There are some font defaults that will work out of the box, but I recommend you install these fonts (for free!) for the full theme design:

- [Source Serif](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Source+Serif+4)
- [DM Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/DM+Sans)
